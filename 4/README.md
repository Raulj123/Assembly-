If you have a AMD proccesor this program may not work for you! 
Reasons? I have an intel CPU and getting CPU info and max speed may vary.

Welcome to Square Root Benchmarks by Raul Jarquin Valdez

Your CPU is Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-7500U CPU @ 2.70GHz

Your max clock speed is 3500 MHz
Please enter a floating radicand for square root bench marking: 4.0

The square root of 4.000000 is 2.000000.

Next enter the number of times iteration should be performed: 1000000

The time on the clock is -546852047 tics.

The bench mark of the sqrtsd instruction is in progress.

The time on the clock is -525514366 tics and the benchmark is completed.

The elapsed time was 21337681 tics

The time for one square root computation is 7.902845 tics which equals 2.700000 ns.

The main function has received this number 2.700000 and will keep it for future reference. The main function will return a zero to the operating system.
