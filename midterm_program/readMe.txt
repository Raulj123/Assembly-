Typo:
    Asked to output "Welcome Bus driver Joseph Crunch"
    in input_array module? im sure this was a mistake dosent make snese to do that.
    Used manager.asm to display that 

Typo: 
    Already talked about in email "The original intent was to that you pass back the name of the user."
    However in sample you have "Good-bye Bus driver Joseph Crunch" displaying title & name 
    Once again I am sure this is a typo 
    displayed only name in main.c
